## Step 1: Rename on GitHub (You Need to Do This Manually)

### Instructions:

1. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   https://github.com/Hanimn/Claude-idea
   ```

2. **Click on "Settings"** (tab at the top of the repo page)

3. **Scroll down** to the "Repository name" section (should be near the top)

4. **Change the name** from `Claude-idea` to `StegoCrew`

5. **Click "Rename"** button

6. **GitHub will show a warning** - that's normal! Just confirm the rename.

### ⚠️ Important Note:
GitHub will automatically redirect `Claude-idea` to `StegoCrew` for a while, but we'll update everything to use the new name.

## Step 2: Update Your Local Git Configuration

After you rename on GitHub, come back here and tell me **"Done!"**

I'll then run the commands to update your local repository to point to the new name.

## Step 3: Update All Documentation

Once Step 2 is complete, I'll automatically update:
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ LEARNING_GUIDE.md
- ✅ LinkedIn posts
- ✅ All references to the old name

---

## Step 4: Create Repo Description & Branding

I'll also create:
- ✅ Catchy GitHub repository description
- ✅ Repository topics/tags
- ✅ Updated About section text

---

**🎯 ACTION REQUIRED: Go rename the repo on GitHub now, then tell me "Done!"**

I'll be waiting to complete the rest! 🚀
